This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.  The dataset contains anonymized transaction data, including transaction amounts, times, and a binary "Class" label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).  The dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with a vast majority of transactions being legitimate.
